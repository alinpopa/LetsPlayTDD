Capital gains

Get rid of SavingsAccountYear initializers
Clean up

Fix primitive obsession

Consider what to do about withdrawing more than the starting balance -- assert that this is impossible?
Fix SavingsAccountYearTest.newAccount abstraction -- use it or don't!
We're passing capitalGainsTaxRate everywhere -- put it in constructor?
Eliminate totalWithdrawnExceptCapitalGains()
