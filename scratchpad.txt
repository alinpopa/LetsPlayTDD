Capital gains

Get rid of SavingsAccountYear initializers
Clean up

Fix primitive obsession
Make sure nextYear() is setting all variables properly -- need to carry forward capital gains, for example
Calculate endingCapitalGains()

Consider what to do about withdrawing more than the starting balance -- assert that this is impossible?
Fix SavingsAccountYearTest.newAccount abstraction -- use it or don't!
We're passing capitalGainsTaxRate everywhere -- put it in constructor?
